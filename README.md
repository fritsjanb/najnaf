Prototype cloud application of the course IN4392 Seminar Cloud Computing at Delft University of Technology.

The application runs on systems that have the OpenNebula command interface enabled (such that you can issue "onevm" commands).

The VM images require python 2.7 to be installed as well as Apache Apollo 1.5, the Python STOMP and PIL libraries (see the init.sh files for more details).
